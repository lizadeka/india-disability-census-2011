# 🧠 India Census Disability Data Analyzer – C-20 SC (2011)

This project analyzes the *Disability by Type and Gender* data for **Scheduled Castes (SC)** from the C-20 Census 2011 tables published by the Government of India. It covers all states and union territories.

## 📊 What This Project Does
- Scrapes and parses 35+ Excel files from [censusindia.gov.in](https://censusindia.gov.in)
- Extracts structured data on disability type, gender, region (rural/urban), and district/state
- Cleans and merges inconsistent schemas (33 to 30-column mismatch handling)
- Summarizes total disabled populations by:
  - State
  - District
  - Gender
  - Disability type
- Visualizes key patterns using Pandas, matplotlib (or Streamlit, optional)

## 🔧 Tools & Tech Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- BeautifulSoup for data extraction
- Excel (.xlsx) automation with `openpyxl`
- Streamlit (optional for interactive dashboard)
- Git for version control

## 🧩 Example Insights
- Top 5 states with highest disabled SC population
- Gender gap in disability types (e.g., movement vs. mental illness)
- Urban–Rural disability distribution heatmaps (if extended)

## 📁 Folder Structure

🔍 After exploring multiple project ideas, I wanted to work on something meaningful and technically strong — something that 
truly adds value to my resume as a Data Analyst.
So, after exploring numerous data sources and ideas, I decided to deep-dive into something that could 
not only strengthen my resume but also highlight my data analysis skills.
I turned to the India Census 2011 — one of the richest public datasets available. But I soon realized that 
many commonly studied topics had already been widely analyzed.

🔍 After some thorough searching, I came across the Disability Data for Scheduled Caste (C-20 SC) population — an important and underexplored dataset.

🔧 I scraped 35+ Excel files from censusindia.gov.in using BeautifulSoup, parsed and cleaned them with Pandas, and analyzed trends by:

    State & district

    Gender

    Type of disability (seeing, hearing, speech, mental illness, multiple, etc.)

📊 Key insights included:

    Which states have the highest disability burden among SCs

    Gender-based patterns in types of disability

    Rural-urban splits across India

🛠️ Tools Used: Python · BeautifulSoup · Pandas · Seaborn · Matplotlib

🧭 What’s next? I plan to build an interactive Streamlit app to make these insights more accessible.

I faced multiple technical challenges:

    ❌ While scraping data from the Census India website, I struggled to extract the correct download links using BeautifulSoup due to messy and inconsistent HTML structures.
    👉 Solved it with help from ChatGPT and refined my scraping logic to correctly capture all 35+ Excel files.

    ❌ While merging Excel files, I hit “Length mismatch” errors because some files had different column counts or orders.
    👉 I had to write custom cleaning scripts in Pandas to standardize and merge all files into one consolidated dataset.

🧩 The project wasn’t without challenges:

    Each state had a separate Excel file, with inconsistencies in column structure.

    I encountered “Length mismatch” errors due to unexpected differences in the number of columns.

    Some columns had different names or orders, making it hard to align and merge data across all files.

    I had to build custom logic to read, clean, and harmonize all the files into a single usable DataFrame.
